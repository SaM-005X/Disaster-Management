We observed a troubling paradox: while disaster management plans existed on paper, a culture of genuine preparedness was missing where it matters mostâ€”in our schools and colleges. Students and staff, the heart of our communities, were often left unprepared to face crises like earthquakes, floods, or fires.");

We do this by focusing on key pillars like engaging education, practical training via virtual drills, localized awareness, and connected communities.");
